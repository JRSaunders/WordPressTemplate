we need to clearly out put "title" and "content"

content:  will just be the html of a normal wordpress blog

we use a short_code in wordpress " [blog_site_plug]"  put this in 3/4 of the way through the article!

the h1 title should be in the 'title'  json as plain text - IT SHOULD NOT BE IN THE BODY! (other wise it will appear twice on the blog!

example json output!
  {
                    "title": "[title]",
                    "body": "[content]",
                    "meta_description": "[description]",
                    "dalle_prompt":"[dalle 3 prompt - that is just an image and no text in the image ]"
  }
```
